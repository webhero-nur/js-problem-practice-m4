 * After using var, we are still gatting error. JavaScript is a case sensitive language. Means, "Var" and "var" are not the same thing.
 * As we need to write library key as it is, we are getting an error as JS is a case sensitive language.
 * Another mistake is, we didn't close/end the line. To end the line we need to add a semicolon (;) in the end.
